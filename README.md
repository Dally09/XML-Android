# XML "eXtensible Markup Language"-Android
Intro to XML files.
Here is an example of an XML file.
# Example 1" XML Files in Python"

# Notes
The top most element (studentList) is referred to as the root element, it contains all other element (student id) known as child element.
The beginning and end of each element are represented by a starting tag (e.g., "<firstName>") and a closing tag (e.g., "</firstName>") respectively.
XML is used to represent and share structured information, whereas HTML is used to display content on web pages.
# Document Type Definition (DTD)
To create custom tags, a developer writes a Document Type Definition (DTD), which is XML’s version of a tag library. An XML file’s DTD is indicated at the top of the file, and tells the software what each tag means and what to do with it.
SOAP APIs and REST APIs, send information to other applications packaged in XML files.
